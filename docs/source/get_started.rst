Intro
~~~~~

Click ``<Enter>`` to skip the intro

Sheet Selection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| The sheets are detected in ``muser/assets/sheets/``.
| Default sheets are packaged in a separate .zip file which you can
  download through latest releases.
| To install sheets, copy ``sheets`` folder in the packaged sheets to
  ``muser/assets/`` under the root path.
| You can select sheets using ``<Left>`` or ``<Right>``.
| For every sheet, there are selections of hardness level. You can use
  ``<Up>`` or ``<Down>`` to change the level.
| Press ``<Space>`` to start the playthrough.

PlayThrough
~~~~~~~~~~~

-  You can see that there are three rings: red, blue and purple rings.
-  There are arrows during playthrough, coming from four directions: up,
   down, left, right.
-  The arrows move toward the center(where the rings are).
-  The player has to touch the corresponding key(arrow keys) at the
   exact time or the arrows will be missed

..

   -  If the note is in the red ring when pressed, it will be a
      **perfect** note

   -  If the note is not in the red ring but the blue one, it will be a
      **great** note

   -  If the note is not in the blue ring but in the purple ring, it
      will be a **bad** note

   -  If the note has passed the rings but the player hasnâ€™t pressed the
      corresponding key yet, then the note will be indicated as **MISS**

   -  The *total score* is **100000**.

   -  There is a weight for each indicator:

   -  **perfect**: 3

   -  **great**: 2

   -  **bad**: 1

   -  For each note pressed by the player, the score will be increased
      by:

   -  scoreToAdd = 100000 / (weight \* noteCount)

The player can quit the playthrough to go back to sheet selection cast
using ``<Q>`` key.

Result
~~~~~~

| The player gets various grades in different ranges of score
  percentage:
| S: score >= 95
| A: 90 <= score < 95
| B: 80 <= score < 90
| C: 70 <= score < 80
| D: 60 <= score < 70
| F: 0 <= score < 60
| The grade is shown in the center of the screen.
| There are counters of **perfects**, **greats**, **bads**, and
  **misses** under the grade.
| Press ``<Enter>`` to return to the sheet selection cast.
